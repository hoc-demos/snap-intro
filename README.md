# Drawing Shapes

These are works by artists Josef Albers, Atta Kwami, Theo van Doesburg, and Vassily Kandinsky. The styles are different, but all of them are based on polygons or circles.

In this lab, you'll explore the basics of drawing a shape in Snap! by using the repeat block to loop through the same code multiple times. Once you can draw polygons, you can create your own art.

### Algorithm

An algorithm is a sequence of steps that are usually performed by a computer. In some programming languages, like Snap!, you program algorithms by dragging blocks (individual instructions) and snapping them together. In other languages, you type the instructions. The idea is the same.

An algorithm isn't a computer program (it isn't the code) but rather a general description of the steps the computer should follow. The algorithm isn't specific to a particular programming language; once you know the steps that the computer will take (that is, once you have your algorithm), you can write the code in the language of your choice.

#### 1. Before you start coding, imagine what this algorithm will make the sprite do:

#### 2. Build the script to test your hypothesis.
* Clicking on the script runs it.
* Click it, and watch what the script does.
* Click the **pen down** block in the **Pen** palette and then click you script to run again.

#### 3. Experiment
* Change 100 to 50 in the **move** block in the **Motion** palette and click the script again to run it with the new input value.
* Click the **clear** block in the **Pen** palette. (you can click the **clear** or any block in the palette or in the scripting area to run it)
* Change the number of degrees in the **turn** blck and run the script again... and again... and again.
* Change the number in the **repeat** block.
* Try to draw a triangle.
* Use the **set pen size to** block in the **Pen** palette to set the pen size to something like 4 or 10 or 50. 
* Draw something.
