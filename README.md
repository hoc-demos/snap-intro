Before beginning this exercise, read through the following topics:
* [Algorithms](https://chnn-anne.gitbook.io/javascript-1/algorithms)
* [The DRY Principle](https://chnn-anne.gitbook.io/javascript-1/dry-principle)

#### Drawing a Square

Draw a square in the center of the stage with sides of length 100. Remember to add a **pen down** command at the beginning and a **pen up** command at the end.

#### Draw a Triangle
Based on your knowledge from drawing a square, create a series of commands to draw a triangle. 

If you are having trouble with the angle to turn, think about the direction the sprite it pointing and how far it needs to rotate when it turns.

#### Draw a Pentagon and an Octagon
Based on your knowledge from drawing a square and a triangle, create a series of commands to draw a pentagon (five sides) and an octagon (eight sides).

#### Create a Draw Polygon Command Block
Create a command block in the **motion** palette, named **draw polygon**, that will draw all of the shapes above. It should accept to inputs:
* the number of sides
* the length of each side

Create titles for the input parameters so that it is easier to use them.

**hint:** all of the exterior angles need to add up to 360 degrees, so the amount of rotation between each side is 360 divided by the number of sides.

#### Create a Draw Rectangle Command Block
Create a command block in the **motion** palette, named **draw rectangle**, that will draw a rectangle with the specified width and length.

#### Create Art

In the scripting area, set out a collection of the tools and blocks that may be handy in creating your art work. You can adjust the input values for these blocks as needed as you create your art. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/pthWazhu474?rel=0) shows how to create some overlapping regions and then fill some of them with color.

Make your own art. Explore a few different combinations of shape and color. Take screen shots of your art work and save them to your repository and then create a web page that displays your work so you can share them with the class.

To add some randomness to your drawings try using the random reporter in your calls to your shape commands:
